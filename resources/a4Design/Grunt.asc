=== Grunt

`Grunt` is a JavaScript task runner.  Similar to Java's `ant`.  Example tasks:

* minification
* compilation
* unit testing
* linting

.Installation

Grunt is installed as a global `npm` package.

[source, bash]
----
npm install -g grunt-cli
----

.Gruntfile.js

Launching `grunt` will start it looking for a locally installed Grunt package (via Node's `require()`), then applies the configuration from the `Gruntfile.js`.  So  a project would have two directories:

* package.json (the project file. It can include a devDependencies section with Grunt plugins)

* Gruntfile.js
