=== Bower

Bower is another package manager. Bower installs as an `npm` package and can be used as a cli.  It is meant strictly as a client side package manager. A discussion about JavaScript package managers and the difference between Bower and npm can be found http://tech.pro/tutorial/1190/package-managers-an-introductory-guide-for-the-uninitiated-front-end-developer#what_is_bower[here].  Some of the differences:

* Bower maintains a flat dependency list whereas npm will recursively download a package and all the dependent packages of a package. There will be far more packages downloaded with npm. With Bower, the programmer has to ensure dependencies are all met

* Bower can can manage multiple files in a package: js, css, html, png, ttf. npm just packages js.

* npm has a true physical repository of packages whereas the bower online repository is a collection of package metadata pointing to package locations
